# Help Lookup Database
Project for Databases class.

## What does it do?
Upon request, it ingests a schedule page and adds the data to the database. From
there, users and professors can specify which classes they're willing to help
with and when.

## How do I set it up?
This requires an Apache2 server with PHP (probably PHP 7) and MySQL.

## Who Wrote This?
The frontend and async API were written by Tucker (me). The SQL code was written
mostly by Anne and Connor.
